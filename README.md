Light JavaScript Playground - A Google Chrome Extension

Light JavaScript Playground is a playground for testing HTML/CSS/JS
ideas in Google Chrome.

lightjs does not rely on a backend. It does not send the HTML/CSS/JS
content to any external server (unless exported to jsfiddle.net).

lightjs does, however, rely on external libraries, if used. Various
CDNs are used to load libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap and others.

lightjs uses the following libraries:
 * [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/)
 * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
 * [icoMoon](http://icomoon.io/) icons (3 icons, embedded in icons.css)

lightjs is shared under the [MIT License](https://github.com/jorgenys/lightjs/blob/master/LICENSE).

Files under extenstion/lib are external dependencies and have their own
licenses.
